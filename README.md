# ðŸŒ… Project Title:

**Dynamic Greeting Website â€” Time of Day Responsive Design**

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

> Create a responsive website that displays a different greeting depending on the current hour of the day (morning, afternoon, or night).
> Your page should use JavaScript to determine the time and show/hide the correct greeting using Bootstrapâ€™s d-none class.

**Each greeting section should have a unique design, applying:**

- [X] Color palette choices that fit the time of day

- [X] Basic design principles (contrast, alignment, balance, repetition, and proximity)

- [X] Custom CSS animations or transitions that enhance (not overwhelm) the design

- [X] Students should use class time effectively to write, debug, and refine both their design and functionality.

## ðŸ’» Requirements
### ðŸ§© Functionality

- [X] JavaScript detects the current hour and determines whether it is morning (5 AMâ€“11:59 AM), afternoon (12 PMâ€“5:59 PM), or night (6 PMâ€“4:59 AM).

- [X] Only the appropriate greeting is visible (others hidden using d-none).

- [X] Includes at least one animation or transition per greeting section (e.g., fade in/out, slide, color transition).

### ðŸŽ¨ Design

- [X] Each time-of-day section must have its own visual theme (colors, typography, and layout).

- [x] The site must use Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness.

- [x] Design principles should be clearly demonstrated.

- [x] Animations must feel intentional and cohesive, not distracting.

### ðŸ§  Development Process

- [x] Must show progress during in-class work sessions (development, debugging, refinement).
*All code should be commented and organized.*
